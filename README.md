# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard
A Power BI & MySQL project
# Project Overview
This project is a dashboard for Coffee Shop Sales, which visualizes key metrics such as sales, orders, quantities over time, across locations, and by product categories. The goal is to enable stakeholders to monitor performance (daily, monthly), compare with prior periods (month-on-month), and dive into details (day, hour, product category, store location).

## the questions which are use in SQL and  analytics the dashboard answers:
  1).Calculate total sales for each respective month.                                                                                                                                                                  
  2).Determine month-on-month increase or decrease in sales.                                                                                                                                                           
  3).Calculate the number of orders for each respective month.                                                                                                                                                         
  4).Month-on-month change in number of orders.                                                                                                                                                                        
  5).Calculate the total quantity sold for each respective month.                                                                                                                                                      
  6).Month-on-month change in total quantity sold.                                                                                                                                                                     
  7).Tooltip to display detailed metrics (Sales, Orders, Quantity) for a specific day.                                                                                                                                 
  8).Segment sales data into Weekdays vs Weekends to analyze performance variations.                                                                                                                                   
  9).Visualize sales data by different store locations.                                                                                                                                                                
  10).Calculate the average sales of months.                                                                                                                                                                           
  11).Calculate the daily average sales of a month.                                                                                                                                                                    
  12).Find the difference between daily average sales and monthly average sales (Above/Below Average).
